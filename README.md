# Tunes Project

This repository provides a history of the Capsule House 1/1 Seerlight Raffle system.

Raffles are held every other month, starting 11/2021. 
To qualify, you must have held a Capsule for at least 30 days. 
Each Capsule is equivalent to one entry.

# Implementation Details

Prior to the drawing, a list of all qualified addresses with their corresponding Capsule IDs will be posted here, as well as the list of capsule IDs.

On the day of the drawing, we will use `getRandomNumber` on https://etherscan.io/address/0x85f16125fadef90aa0b5373fb5b8b870883c60c0 to generate a Chainlink VRF random seed. For example, let's say there are five Capsules eligible for the raffle, with the ids:

```
17
52
283
591
5183
```

Let's say Chainlink returns `87314876641541055251095431619250856243264627284949971051498783260561907368646` as our random seed.

To get the index of the winner, we do `87314876641541055251095431619250856243264627284949971051498783260561907368646 % 5 = 1`

The capsule at index 1 is 52, so the owner of Capsule 52 wins at the time of the snapshot.
